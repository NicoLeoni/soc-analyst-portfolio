# SOC Analyst – Learning Portfolio

This repository documents my learning process and hands-on practice
towards a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst role.

At this stage, the focus is on understanding:
- Basic security concepts
- Logs and log sources
- Incident analysis fundamentals

This portfolio will grow as I progress through structured labs
and practical exercises.
